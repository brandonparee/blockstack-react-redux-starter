```

The application will be available at `localhost:3000`

## FAQ

> I'm getting a 'Sign in Request' error when attempting to authenticate with Blockstack

You'll need to disable CORS stuff for only `localhost:3000`. I use
[Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi/related?hl=en)
for Chrome. The only rule I have enabled in the extension is `http://localhost:3000/*`.
